#Android project | IDI QT 2016/2017
How do I run it?

	Install Android Studio, then compile the .apk file with it. [eso es mentira, que hay que darles uno a estos]

I don't understand anything! Where's the documentation?

	Documentation can (NOT YET) be found on Informe.pdf (source on Informe.tex). Because the subject is taught in catalan, it's written in said language. However, we plan on at least translating it to English.
