#Android project | IDI QT 2016/2017
How do I run it?

	Install the APK on your Android device.

What do I need to check the source code?

	Obviously, an Android Studio build. You can also do it with any IDE, but AS was designed for Android development.

What can I do with this app
	
	You can add, delete or edit a set of books (we recommend using this app to log books that you've read). They can also be found and sorted by several criteria.

Made by Miguel Moreno and Marta Barroso for the subject "Interaction and Interface Design" (IDI) at FIB (UPC, Barcelona) on the autumn course, year 2016. Our mark has been 10/10, and to say that we are proud of our app would be an understatement! ðŸ˜„
